Voila! Now you can generate public or private key pair using PuTTYgen.

### 1.3 Types of Keys Supported on PuTTYgen
It is important to know the types of key PuTTYgen supports prior to using it. Below are the key types that it currently supports for SSH-2 and SSH-1 protocol:

SSH-1 protocol: For SSH-1 only supports one key i.e. Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)

SSH-2 protocol: SSH-2 supports multiple key types that include – Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Ed25519.

### 1.4 Export OpenSSH key
Export the generated key to OpenSSH: Conversions => Export OpenSSH key

### 1.5 Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account
Go to Settings => SSH and GPG keys => New SSH key and copy the public key generated by PuTTYgen.

# 2. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. 

In a new admin elevated PowerShell window, ensure the ssh-agent is running.

## 2.1 Go to the SSH keys directory
Open PowerShell window as administrator.
```shell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh"
```
## 2.2 Start the ssh-agent in the background
```shell
Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
Start-Service ssh-agent
```
## 2.3 Add your SSH key
```shell
ssh-add github_rsa
```
# 3. Testing your SSH connection
You'll need to authenticate this action using your password, which is the SSH key passphrase you created earlier.

## 3.1 Attempts to ssh to GitHub
```shell
ssh -vT git@github.com
> Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
## 3.2 SSH works, but git clone doesn't
If direct SSH test works but git clone doesn't, let's create an SSH config file:
```shell
notepad $env:USERPROFILE/.ssh/config
```
Add these lines:
```shell
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile $env:USERPROFILE/.ssh/github_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

# 5. Local Development

# 5.1 Open index.html in your browser

# 6. Github dev
If you add the .dev ending instead of .com to the repo link, e.g

https://github.com/Mel-Capcha-C2/My_Git_Training- => https://github.dev/Mel-Capcha-C2/My_Git_Training-

you will access the web editor. However, to create a terminal view you can create a GitHub Codespace, or clone the repo in a local machine and work from VS Code.

## 6.0 Git Hidden Folder

There is a hidden folder called `.git` which tells you that our project is a git repo.

If we wanted to create a git repo in a new project we create the folder and then initialize that repo using `git init`

```sh
mkdir /workspaces/tmp/new-project
cd /workspaces/tmp/new-project
git init
touch Readme.md
code Readme.md
git status
git add Readme.md
# Make changes to Readme.md
git commit -a -m "Add Readme file
```

## 6.1 Cloning

We can clone three ways: HTTPS, SSH, Github CLI

Since we are usng Github Codespaces we'll create a temporary directory in our workspace.

```sh
mkdir /workspace/tmp
cd /workspace/tmp
```

### 6.1.1 HTTPS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mel-Capcha-C2/My_Git_Training-.git
cd My_Git_Training-
```

## 6.2 Commands

### 6.2.1 Add

When we want to stage changes that will be included in the commit.
We use the period . to add all files.

```sh
git add Readme.md
git add .
```

### 6.2.2 Reset

Reset allows you to move Staged changes to be unstaged.

```sh
git add .
git reset
```

### 6.2.3 Status
Shows you what files will or will not be commited.

```sh
git status
```

### 6.2.4 Commit

When we want to commit code we can write git commit which will open the commit edit message in the editor of choice.

```sh
git commit
```

### 6.2.5 Gitconfig file

The gitconfig file is what stores global configurations for git such as email, name, editor and more.


```sh
git config --list --show-origin
```
or
```sh
git config --list --show-scope
```

When you first install Git on a machine you are supposed to set up your name and email.

```sh
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Set the global editor

```sh
git config --global core.editor $EDITOR
```

To see the possible values for $EDITOR see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config. For example, for visual studio code is the following:

```sh
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
