# 2.Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. 

In a new admin elevated PowerShell window, ensure the ssh-agent is running.

# 2.1 Go to the SSH keys directory

cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh"

# 2.2 Start the ssh-agent in the background
Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
Start-Service ssh-agent

# 2.3 Add your SSH key
ssh-add github_rsa
